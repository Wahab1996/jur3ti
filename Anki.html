Typical starting total daily insulin dose for T1DM (units/kg/day)?,0.4–1.0 (usually 0.5)
In T1DM, insulin is divided into what ratio between basal and prandial doses?,50% basal / 50% prandial
During the T1DM “honeymoon phase,” insulin requirements should be reduced.
Which injectable amylin analog may be used (rarely) as adjunct therapy in T1DM?,Pramlintide
Indication for pancreas or islet transplantation in diabetes?,Recurrent DKA or severe hypoglycemia despite optimal therapy

Metformin should be avoided if eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73m².
Which diabetes drug class provides cardiorenal protection and may cause genital infections?,SGLT-2 inhibitors
GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., Semaglutide) are preferred in which comorbidities?,ASCVD, CKD, or obesity
Sulfonylureas increase risk of what adverse effect?,Hypoglycemia
Pioglitazone is contraindicated in which comorbidity?,Congestive heart failure
Expected HbA1c reduction with monotherapy of most oral agents?,About 1%
Basal–bolus insulin regimen composition ratio?,50% basal / 50% bolus
Example basal insulins used in basal–bolus therapy?,Glargine, Detemir, Degludec
Basal-only insulin regimen is suitable for which patients?,Fasting hyperglycemia or new-onset T2DM
In basal insulin titration, increase by how many units every 3 days until fasting glucose target is reached?,2 units
Sliding-scale insulin should not be used alone; what should it always be combined with?,Basal insulin
Preferred antihyperglycemic agents in heart failure?,SGLT-2 inhibitors (Empagliflozin, Dapagliflozin)
Target HbA1c monitoring frequency for uncontrolled diabetes?,Every 3 months
